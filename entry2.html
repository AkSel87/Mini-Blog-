    <h1>"My Mini-Blog – How I Created It"</h1>
    <p>
        My first blog is more than just a project – it is an important step in my journey to becoming a web developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        This mini-blog is my first web development project. I built it using HTML and CSS to learn the basics of  
        web development. My goal was to create a simple and clear structure that connects navigation and content effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is an insight into my process:
        
        1. **Planning:** I defined which pages I needed: Homepage, About Me, Blog Posts, and Contact.  
        2. **HTML Structure:** I created each page as a separate file and linked them together.
