    <h1>Hello, I'm Ak87Sel!</h1>
    <p>
        At the age of 37, I have decided to restart my life. I currently work as a logistics specialist,  
        but my dream is to become a web developer. To achieve this goal, I have set up a clear plan:  
        I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to master the fundamentals of web development within 28 weeks.
        
        This blog is part of my learning journey. Here, I document my progress, challenges, and insights.
